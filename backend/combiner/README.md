# Combiner Communication Example

Welcome to my super simple example illustrating how to communicate with the combiner backend using Typescript!
Everything in the App folder (ie all the helpful types and maps and etc, ie all the competently written code) is
stolen whole-cloth from Phil's combiner server project.

## Getting started

Just run npm install and then npm start. Then you can send a simple GET request using Postman or whatever to localhost
(port 8000) to see all the attributes of all the stock units in Tellurian.
